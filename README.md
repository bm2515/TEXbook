Welcome to the DEMO of NYU Shanghai Used Textbook Online Marketplace. This demo was built to propose a solution to exceeding textbook costs and non-recyclable textbook practices.
The DEMO uses Flask, MySQL, JQuery, PHP, AJAX, Node.JS, CSS, JavaScript

After the approval of the idea by the University, an online marketplace is currently in development. It uses Java SpringBoot, REACT, and MySQL. It will be deployed on NYU servers by the end of August (in time for student to purchase used textbooks for Fall 2021).
